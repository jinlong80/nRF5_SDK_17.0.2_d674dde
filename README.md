https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/topic/ug_nrf52840_dongle/UG/nrf52840_Dongle/intro.html

The nRF52840 Dongle (PCA10059) is the preferred hardware to be used with the nRF Connect for Desktop software package to develop and test your nRF-based wireless solutions. The hardware supports all the short range wireless standards available on the nRF52 family of devices, and the built-in USB device controller provides a high data throughput communication interface.

The nRF52840 Dongle can also be used together with the nRF5 SDK for product development based on the the nRF52840 SoC.

The nRF52840 Dongle is a low-cost, versatile USB development dongle for Bluetooth® Low Energy, ANT™, 802.15.4, and user-proprietary 2.4 GHz applications using the nRF52840 SoC.

Key features:

nRF52840 flash-based ANT/ANT+™, Bluetooth Low Energy SoC solution
Button and LEDs for user interaction
15 GPIO available on a castellated edge
Onboard USB bootloader with buttonless support
USB support
